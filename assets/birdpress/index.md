# Hello, Bird World!
This is the index of your BirdPress site. You should overwrite
assets/birdpress/index.md for a basic webpage layout.

If you're feeling extra fancy, you can override the home page (which is called
the BirdHouse) using Flutter Widgets to give your site some extra flair.

## BirdPress
BirdPress allows you to write blog posts and static pages for your website.

## BirdPress, for you
This example BirdPress site can be found at [https://github.com/imichaelnorris/birdpress_example](https://github.com/imichaelnorris/birdpress_example).
